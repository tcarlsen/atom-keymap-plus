# Atom keymap plus

> An easy way to expand the keymap feature in [Atom](http://atom.io).

## What is this

The idea is to make it easier to use the same keymap for multiple plugins without them overlapping each other.

At the moment there is only on class function `setFileClasses()`, but more will come as needed.

## Usage

Heres an example on how to use `setFileClasses()`

Inside your activation
```javascript
var keymap = require('atom-keymap-plus');

module.exports = {
    activate: function () {
        'use strict';

        keymap.setFileClasses();
    }
};
```

Now you are able to make keymaps that a specific to a file type like this
```json
{
    ".editor.javascript": {
        "cmd-alt-l": "jslint"
    },
    ".editor.css": {
        "cmd-alt-l": "csslint"
    }
}
```
