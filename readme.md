# Atom keymap plus

> An easy way to expand the keymap feature in [Atom](http://atom.io).

# This packages is no longer maintained!

### There is no longer a need for this package since you can do this the native Atom way:

```cson
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source js']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source css']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source json']":
"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='text html basic']":
```


~~## What is this~~

~~The idea is to make it easier to use the same keymap for multiple plugins without them overlapping each other.~~

~~Keymap plus makes it possible to have the same keymap do different things. This is achieve by adding class names to the editor. That way you can use additional classes when assigning keymaps.~~

~~At the moment there is only one class function (`setFileClasses()`), that makes it posible to base your keymap on the active grammar.~~

~~## Usage~~

~~Heres an example on how to use `setFileClasses()`~~

~~Inside your activation~~
```javascript
var keymap = require('atom-keymap-plus');

module.exports = {
    activate: function () {
        'use strict';

        keymap.setFileClasses();
    }
};
```

~~Now you are able to make keymaps that a specific to a file type like this~~
```json
{
    ".editor.javascript": {
        "cmd-alt-l": "jslint"
    },
    ".editor.css": {
        "cmd-alt-l": "csslint"
    }
}
```
